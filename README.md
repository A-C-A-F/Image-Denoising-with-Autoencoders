# Image-Denoising-with-Autoencoders
Image Noise Reduction with Auto-encoders using TensorFlow

In this project, we will learn the basics of image noise reduction with auto-encoders. Auto-encoding is an algorithm to help reduce dimensionality of data with the help of neural networks.

__Data Source:__ MNIST dataset

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Develop an understanding of Auto-encoders.
2.	Be able to apply Image Noise Reduction with Auto-encoders.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ An introduction to the problem, as well as a summary of the imports we will need.
- __Task 2:__ Data Preprocessing
- __Task 3:__ Adding Noise
- __Task 4:__ Building and Training a Classifier
- __Task 5:__ Building the Auto-encoder
- __Task 6:__ Training the Auto-encoder
- __Task 7:__ Denoised Images
- __Task 8:__ Composite Model
